# DngMode üöÄ

**DngMode** is a CLI tool that streamlines your development workflow by automating project setup tasks and providing quick access to frequently used tools. Built with Node.js and NestJS, **DngMode** simplifies repetitive actions for developers by opening projects in VS Code, setting up project-specific to-do lists, opening Spotify, and more. With DngMode, you can jump right into coding without hassle.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Project Quick Access**: Choose and open projects directly in VS Code.
- **Task Management**: Maintain a to-do list for each project, with customizable task priorities.
- **Automated Launch**: Open additional tools, such as Spotify and Postman, when initializing your projects.
- **Simple Commands**: Use intuitive commands to interact with your project directories, add tasks, and manage projects efficiently.
- **Configurable Setup**: Customize your project directory and tool preferences using a config file.

2. Run the following command to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. **Link the CLI locally** (if testing without publishing):

```

## Configuration

Create a `dng.config.json` file in your home directory to customize project paths and preferences.

```
